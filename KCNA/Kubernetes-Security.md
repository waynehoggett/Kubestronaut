# Kubernetes Security

- The 4Cs of cloud native security are:
    - Cloud - Least control over
    - Clusters
    - Containers
    - Code - Most control over
- Authentication methods:
    - Client certificates - Used by kubectl
    - OpenID connect tokens - Uses a JSON Web Token (JWT) signed by the provider, used for integration with external identity providers
    - And more!
- Authorization methods:
    - Node - Used by the kubelet to work with resources on a specific node
    - Attribute Based Access Control (ABAC) - Use **policies** that refer to attributes of users, resources, etc to authorize access
    - Role Based Access Controle (RBAC) - Assign **granular permissions** to roles, then assign roles to users
    - Webhook - Reach out to an external service to authorize requests
- OPA Gatekeeper - Create and enforce policies that control what cna and cannot be done in your Kubernetes environment
    - Validates incoming requests according to policies
    - API denies requests that violate policy are denied
    - Is an external tool, not a Kubernetes specific tool
- Control groups are used to provide isolation for container processes, keeping them separate from the other processes on the host.
