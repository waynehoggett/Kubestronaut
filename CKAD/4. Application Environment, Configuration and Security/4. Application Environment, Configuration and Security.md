# Application Environment, Configuration and Security

## Discover and use resources that extend Kubernetes (CRD, Operators)

- A resource is anything created within our cluster
- Resources can be built-in or custom
- A custom resource is a way to extend kubernetes by creating new object types
- Custom resources require:
  - A custom resource definition (CRD)
  - An operator (To implement the CRD)
  - A deployment that uses the CRD resource
- Sample Custom Resource Definition (CRD):
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
  kind: CustomResourceDefinition
  metadata:
  # name must match the spec fields below, and be in the form: <plural>.<group>
  name: crontabs.stable.example.com
  spec:
  # group name to use for REST API: /apis/<group>/<version>
  group: stable.example.com
  # list of versions supported by this CustomResourceDefinition
  versions:
      - name: v1
      # Each version can be enabled/disabled by Served flag.
      served: true
      # One and only one version must be marked as the storage version.
      storage: true
      schema:
          openAPIV3Schema:
          type: object
          properties:
              spec:
              type: object
              properties:
                  cronSpec:
                  type: string
                  image:
                  type: string
                  replicas:
                  type: integer
  # either Namespaced or Cluster
  scope: Namespaced
  names:
      # plural name to be used in the URL: /apis/<group>/<version>/<plural>
      plural: crontabs
      # singular name to be used as an alias on the CLI and for display
      singular: crontab
      # kind is normally the CamelCased singular type. Your resource manifests use this.
      kind: CronTab
      # shortNames allow shorter string to match your resource on the CLI
      shortNames:
      - ct
  ```
- Sample deployment manifest that utilizes the CRD:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: "stable.example.com/v1"
  kind: CronTab
  metadata:
    name: my-new-cron-object
  spec:
    cronSpec: "* * * * */5"
    image: my-awesome-cron-image
  ```

## Understand authentication, authorization and admission control

### Authorization

- There are two types of access control:
  - Role-based access control (RBAC) (Default)
  - Attribute-based access control - Can be enabled, not part of the CKAD
- Sample custom (namespace-scoped) role:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: Role #Use ClusterRole to create a non-scoped role
  metadata:
  namespace: default
  name: pod-reader
  rules:
    - apiGroups: [""] # "" indicates the core API group
  resources: ["pods"]
  verbs: ["get", "watch", "list"]
  ```
- Sample role binding:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  # This role binding allows "jane" to read pods in the "default" namespace.
  # You need to already have a Role named "pod-reader" in that namespace.
  kind: RoleBinding # Use ClusterRoleBinding for a cluster-scoped role binding
  metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
  subjects:
  # You can specify more than one "subject"
  - kind: User
      name: jane # "name" is case sensitive
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  roleRef:
  # "roleRef" specifies the binding to a Role / ClusterRole
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: pod-reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  ```

### Admission Controllers

- Two steps:
  1. Enable the admission controller plugin on the API server
  1. If required, configure the admission controller, each configuration is unique, refer to the docs to configure
- Check if they are enabled or not:

  ```sh
  ps -ef | grep kube-apiserver
  ```

  ```sh
  kube-apiserver -h | grep enable-admission-plugins
  ```

  ```sh
  sudo nano /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver.yaml
  ```

## Understand requests, limits, quotas

### Resource Limits and Requests

- Requests and Limits are configured on **Pods**
- Requests estimate the resources needed for a pod
- Limits terminate resources when the limit is reached
- Request values must be less than limit values
- Sample request and limit:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
  name: frontend
  spec:
  containers:
  - name: app
      image: images.my-company.example/app:v4
      resources:
      requests:
          memory: "64Mi"
          cpu: "250m"
      limits:
          memory: "128Mi"
          cpu: "500m"
  ```

### Resource Quotas

- Resource quotas are enforced by an Admission Controller that is enabled by default in version 1.29+
- Resource Quotas apply to a namespace
- When a scope is added to a quota, it limits the resources it supports to those that pertain to the scope, anything outside the scope results in a validation error
- Sample resource quota:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ResourceQuota
  metadata:
  name: pods-high
  spec:
  hard:
    cpu: "1000"
    memory: 200Gi
    pods: "10"
  scopeSelector:
    matchExpressions:
      - operator: In
    scopeName: PriorityClass
    values: ["high"]
  ```

## Understand ConfigMaps

- ConfigMaps store non-confidential data in key-valiue pairs, that can be resused in multiple pods
- Pods can consume ConfigMaps as:
  - Inside a container Command-line arguments and args
  - Environment variables for a container
  - Configuration files in volumes
  - Custom code (Not required for CKAD)
- **Do not** store secrets in ConfigMaps
- Config maps have a 1MB data limit
- List ConfigMaps using: `kubectl get configmaps`
- Example ConfigMap as YAML:

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: game-demo
  data:
    # property-like keys; each key maps to a simple value
    database_url: "jdbc:mysql://dev.example.com:3386/"
    player_initial_lives: "3"
    # Or file-like keys
    game.properties: |
      enemy.types=aliens,monsters
      player.maximum-lives=5
  ```

- Consume a ConfigMap in a Pod as an Environment Variable:
  ```yaml
  - name: demo
    image: alpine
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
    env:
      - name: PLAYER_INITIAL_LIVES
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            name: game-demo
            key: player_initial_lives
  ```
- Consume a ConfigMap in a Pod as an Argument:
  ```yaml
  - name: demo
    image: alpine
    command: ["sleep", "3600"]
    args: ["$(APP_PORT)"]
    env:
      - name: APP_PORT
        valueFrom:
          configMapKeyRef:
            name: game-demo
            key: app_port
  ```
- Consume a ConfigMap in a Pod as a Volume:
- ConfigMap:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: ConfigMap
  metadata:
    name: haproxy-config
  data:
    haproxy.cfg:
      | # THis haproxy.cfg file will be created in the volume with these contents
      frontend ambassador
        bind *:9090
        default_backend hive_svc
      backend hive_svc
        server svc hive-svc:9076
  ```
- Pod spec:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: mypod
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: mypod
        image: haproxy:stable
        volumeMounts:
          - name: config-volume
            mountPath: "/usr/local/etc/haproxy/"
    volumes:
      - name: config-volume
        configMap: # Mounts the entire config map directly in the volume
          name: haproxy-config
  ```

## Define resource requirements

- Covered in **Resource Limits and Requests**

## Create & consume Secrets

- Secrets store sensitive ifnromation, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys in a resuable way
- Secrets share a lot of the capabilities of ConfigMaps, but are designed to store secret data, including in:
  - Inside a container Command-line arguments and args
  - Environment variables for a container
  - Configuration files in volumes
  - Custom code (Not required for CKAD)
- Secret data must be encrypted
- The most common secret type is **Opaque**, but there are others
- Easily create secrets, including from files, using `kubectl create secret`
  - For example, create a TLS secret from a file using `kubectl create secret tls web-tls --cert=tls.crt --key=tls.key`
- List secrets with `kubectl get secrets`

- Sample secret YAML definition:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: v1
  kind: Secret
  metadata:
    name: db-pass-secret
  type: Opaque
    data:
      db-pass: hJF#KNjsdj2
  ```
  - Sample YAML consuming a secret in a Pod as an Environment Variable:
  ```yaml
  apVersion: v1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: web-pod
  spec:
    containers:
      - name: busybox
        image: busybox:stable
        env:
          - name: DB_PASS
            valueFrom:
              SecretKeyRef:
                name: db-pass-secret
                key: db-pass
  ```
  - Sample YAML consuming a secret as a Volume:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: 1
  kind: Pod
  metadata:
    name: web-pod
  spec:
    volumes:
      - name: secrets-volume
        secret:
          secretName: db-pass-secret
    containers:
      - name: busybox
        image: busybox:stable
        volumeMounts:
          - name: secrets-volume
            readOnly: true
            mountPath: "/tmp/db-pass"
  ```

## Understand ServiceAccounts

- Provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod
- Service Accounts can be authorized to access the kubernetes API using a RoleBinding
- Service Accounts use service tokens to validate the requests to the Kubernetes API, but must be assigned access using RBAC to do so
- Service Accounts must be bound to a pod
- Sample YAML defining a service account:
- Create a service account easily using kubectl: `kubectl create serviceaccount [service-name]`

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: reader-service
automountServiceAccountToken: false # Set to true to automount credentials (default)
```

- Bind a service account to a role using a rolebinding:
  ```yaml
  apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
  kind: RoleBinding # Use ClusterRoleBinding for a cluster-scoped role binding
  metadata:
  name: read-pods
  namespace: default
  subjects:
  - kind: Service
      name: reader-service
      apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  roleRef:
  kind: Role #this must be Role or ClusterRole
  name: reader # this must match the name of the Role or ClusterRole you wish to bind to
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  ```
- Bind a ServiceAccount to a Pod:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  - name: web-pod
spec:
  serviceAccountName: reader-service # <- bound here
  containers:
  ...
```

## Understand Application Security (SecurityContexts, Capabilities, etc.)

- A Security Context definds privilege and access control settings for a Pod or Container in the `SecurityContext` field
- Example options include:
  - UID/GUID settings
  - AppArmor/SELInux options
  - Privilege escalation
  - Seccomp settings
  - Filesystem settings
  - Linux capabilities
- YAML Examples:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  - name: web-pod
spec:
  securityContext:
    runAsUser: 1000 # Heaps of examples here
    runAsGroup: 3000 # Here
    fsGroup: 2000 # Here
    runAsNonRoot: true # Here
    capabilities: # Add and remove capabilities here
      add: ["NET_ADMIN", "SYS_TIME"]
      drop:
        - CAP_NET_BIND_SERVICE
  containers:
  - name: busybox
    image: busybox: stable
```
