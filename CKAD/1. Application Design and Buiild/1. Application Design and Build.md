# Application Design and Build

## Define, build and modify container images

- Docker images or container images are referred to as OCI images
- docker, buildah, and podman can be used to build container images
- When you are tagging images, the format is: <registry>/<repository>/<name>:<version>

### Building images with Docker

- Build an image: `docker image build -t <name>:<version> .`

  - `-t, --tag` is name (or repository) and tag, separated by a colon
  - `.` at the end is the working directory
  - ` -f, --file` the Path/Name of the Docker file, default is current/Dockerfile

  **Example:**

  ```
  docker image build -t ckad:docker .
  ```

- Pull an image: `docker image pull name:tag`

  **Example:**

      ```
      docker image pull alpine:latest
      ```

- Save and image as a _tar_ file: `docker save image:tag --output <name>.tar`

  **Example:**

  ```
  docker save ckad:docker --output ckad.tar
  ```

- Zip an image with gzip: `docker save image:tag | gzip > image.tar.gz`

- Create an image from a running container: `docker commit <container> <iamge name>`

- Rename/tag an image: `docker image <current name>:<current tag> <new name>:<new tag>`

  **Example:**

  ```
  docker image tag ckad:docker waynehoggett/ckad:docker
  ```

- Remove an image: `docker image remove <id/name>`

  - `-f, --force` Force removal of the image

  **Example:**

  ```
  docker image remove 6a87cad0cf40
  ```

- Get help: `docker <command > --help`

### Buildah

- Builds images without a container runtime
- Doesn't need a dockerfile

- Build an image using a Dockerfile: `buildah build -t <name>:<version> `

  - Assumes Dockerfile is in the current directory and working directory is the current directory
  - ` -f, --file` the Path/Name of the Docker file, default is current/Dockerfile

  **Example:**

  ```
  buildah  build -t ckad:docker
  ```

### Podman

- Manages the full container lifecycle like docker
- All Docker command work by swapping `docker` with `podman` e.g. `podman image build`
- Podman doesn't have a daemon, uses buildah to build images

## Choose and use the right workload resource (Development, DaemonSet, CronJob, etc)

### Jobs

Reference: [Jobs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/job/)

- A Job creates one or more Pods and will continue to retry execution of the Pods until a specified number of them successfully terminate
- Managed by the job controller
- Deleting a Job will clean up the Pods it created
- Suspending a Job will delete its active Pods until the Job is resumed
- Jobs can be used to run multiple Pods in parallel
- Architecture of a job is: Container -> Pod -> Job
- Manage jobs with: `kubectl <action> job`

  **Example:**

  ```yaml
  apiVersion: batch/v1
  kind: Job
  metadata:
    name: ckad1
  spec:
    # Max run time
    activeDeadlineSeconds: 10
    # How long to wait before cleaning up a job after it's done, 0 is immediate
    ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 120
    # Run it 5 times
    completions: 5
    # Not in parallel
    parallelism: 1
    # Retry 4 times, with an exponantial delay, with a cap at 6 minutes
    backoffLimit: 4
    template:
      spec:
        containers:
          - name: ctr
            image: alpine:latest
            command: ["sh", "-c", 'echo "Lets smash the CKAD" && sleep 60']
        # Restart policy can be OnFailure or Never
        # Restart will restart on the same node up to the back-off limit
        # Never means you can access the logs of failed pods
        restartPolicy: Never
  ```

### Cronjobs

Reference: [CronJob](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/cron-jobs/)

- Cronjobs are scheduled jobs, they build on top of jobs
- The Cronjob controller has the sole responsibility of starting jobs, handing them off to the job controller
- If the cronjob controller misses more than 100 jobs (e.g downtime) it will throw an error and not try again, also uses `startingDeadlineSeconds` as the check period for the number of failures
- Architecture of a cronjob is: Container -> Pod -> Job -> Cronjob
- Cronjob controller checks for new jobs every 10 seconds (did it miss any while sleeping)
- If you set `startingDeadlineSeconds` to less than 10 seconds your job might be missed
- Manage cronjobs with: `kubectl <action> cronjob`
- Cronjob schedule format:

  ```text
  # ┌───────────── minute (0 - 59)
  # │ ┌───────────── hour (0 - 23)
  # │ │ ┌───────────── day of the month (1 - 31)
  # │ │ │ ┌───────────── month (1 - 12)
  # │ │ │ │ ┌───────────── day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday)
  # │ │ │ │ │                                   OR sun, mon, tue, wed, thu, fri, sat
  # │ │ │ │ │
  # │ │ │ │ │
  # * * * * *
  ```

## Understand multi-container Pod design patterns (e.g. Sidecar, init and others)

- Containers run inside of pods
- More than one container can run inside a pod (Multi-container pods)
- Separation of concerns: Every container only does one thing
- Use multiple containers within a pod when adding concerns, for example, adding support for a specific environment
- Get the logs from a specific container in a pod using:

```
kubectl logs <pod name> -c <container name>
```

### Sidecars

- The second app is usually called the _sidecar_
- There can be one or more sidecars
- Multi-container pod patterns
- **Ambassador pattern:** Runs alongside the main app container for the lifetime of the container, for example, brokering a database connection
- **Adaptor pattern:** Used to adapt logs into another format, runs for the life of the main app container

  **Sidecar Container:**

  ```yaml
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: db # Main container
        <Snip>
        - name: db-admin # Sidecar
          image: adminer
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
  ```

### Init containers

- Adds sidecar logic that runs only as long a required (in a loop), for example: waiting for a backend to start
- The init containers always run first
- The main App container only starts once all of the init containers have completed successfully
- Specified as `initContainers` in the YAML definition
- Can have more than one init container, and they run in the order listed

  **Init Container Example:**

  ```yaml
  containers:
  - name: main-container
  <Snip>
  initContainers:
    - name: check-db
      image: postgres:9.6.5
      command: [
          "sh",
          "-c",
          "until pg_isready -h postgres -p 5432;
          do echo waiting for database; sleep 2; done;",
        ]
  ```

## Utilize persistent and ephemeral volumes

- Volume types:
  - Persistent Volumes: For important data that can't be lost
  - Ephemeral Volumes: for caching and other temp data
- Both volume types are made available via Container Storage Interface (CSI) plugins

### Storage Classes

- Kubernetes Object: `kind: StorageClass`
- Kubectl command: `kubectl <action> storageclass`
- Relates to an external storage system
- Defines settings such as:
  - What do do when it's no longer bound to a pod: ``
  - Whether the volume should wait for a pod or not:
    `volumeBindingMode: WaitForFirstConsumer | Immediate`
  - Expandability, read or read/write, and more...

### Persistent Volume Claims (PVC)

- Kubernetes Object: `kind: PersistentVolumeClaim`

### Volumes

Using a volume in a pod:

```yaml
volumes:
  - name: data
    persistentVolumeClaim:
      claimName: pvc-wait
volumeMounts:
  - mountPath: /data
    name: data
```
