# Services and Networking

## Demonstrate basic understanding of NetworkPolicies

### Understanding NetworkPolicies

- By default Kubernetes networks are open, all traffic is permitted
- Without NetworkPolicies, Kubernetes networks are not fit for production
- A Network Plugin is used to implement Network Policies, e.g. Calico
- A NetworkPolicy can have either Ingress or Egress rules or ideally, both
    - Ingress is traffic coming into a pod
    - Egress is traffic going out from a pod
- Traffic can be permitted based on namespaces, labels or IP blocks, most commonly a label or namespace or both will be used
- Once a policy is configured, all traffic is implicitly denied, there is no deny rule, only allow rules
- All applied policies aggregate
- Network policies are namespaced
- Shorthand `kubectl [action] netpol`
- Sample network policy:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
        name: ps-ckad
    spec:
        podSelector:
            matchLabels:
                project: ckad #Network Policy applies to all pods with this label
        policyTypes:
         - Egress # Or INgress, or both
         # - Ingress
         egress:
          - podSelector:
                matchLabels:
                    role: front-end # rule applies to traffic from this label
                ports:
                 - protocol: TCP
                   port: 9000
                   ...
    ```
- Sample **allow all** policy:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
        name: allow-all
    spec:
      policyTypes:
      - Egress
      - Ingress
      podSelector: {}
      egress:
      - {}
      ingress:
      - {}
    ```
 - Sample **deny all** policy:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: NetworkPolicy
    metadata:
        name: deny-all
    spec:
      policyTypes:
      - Egress
      - Ingress
      podSelector: {}
    ```   
- Be aware of multuple selectors, without the `-` is an AND, with is an OR, generally you will want a logical AND, for example: this namespace in AND that label
```yaml
# this is an AND
- from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
            project: ckad
      namespaceSelector: # Missing a - at the start of this line
        matchLabels:
            kuberenetes.io/metadata.name: ps
```
```yaml
# this is an OR
- from:
    - podSelector:
        matchLabels:
            project: ckad
    - namespaceSelector: # Missing a - at the start of this line
        matchLabels:
            kuberenetes.io/metadata.name: ps
```
- Make sure to know how to select traffic to/from a namespace:
    ```yaml
        - namespaceSelector: # Missing a - at the start of this line
            matchLabels:
                kuberenetes.io/metadata.name: ps
    ```
## Provide and troubleshoot access to applications via services

### Undetstanding Services

- Services provide reliable network access to deployments and stateful sets, use services to connect to apps instead of connecting to pods directly
- Services are made up of a front-end IP Address and a backend where traffic is directed to based on selectors, usually using labels, the labels in the service must match the labels on the pods for traffic to flow to the pods
- There are three types of service:
    - ClusterIP - (Default) Creates an internal Cluster IP address on the Pod Network
    - NodePort - Builds on cluster IP and exposes a static port on all cluster nodes in the range 30000 -> 32767
    - LoadBalancer - Integrates with a cloud load balancer to provide external access to a service, maps 1 load balancer to 1 service, 1:1 LoadBalancer:Service (which can be costly)

### Working with Services

- Imperative commands: `kubectl get | describe svc [service-name]`
- Th service will only be working if Endpoints are listed, that is the pods that will receive traffic based on the selectors, for example:
    ```sh
    Endpoints: 10.2.0.6:8080,10.2.0.7:8080
    ```

- Sample service declaration:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
        name: myapp-service # This name is used to create an internal   DNS name
    spec:
        #type: ClusterIP The default type is cluster IP, can also be NodePort, or LoadBalancer
        selector:
            app: myapp # These labels must exist on the pod
        ports:
        # - nodePort: 30001 required for NodePort Service
        - port: <Port> # This port is used on the front-end
            targetPort: <Target Port> # This is the external pod port
    ```

## Use Ingress rules to expose applications

### Understanding Kubernetes Ingress

- An ingress allow a single load balancer to be used for multiple HTTP/s applications using host-based or path-based routing
- Ingress may provide load balancing, SSL termination and name-based virtual hosting
- Ingresses may be replaced by the Gateway object
- The ingress specification defines the routing rules
- The ingress specification/rules are implemented by an Ingress Controller, for example nginx or App Gateway on Azure
- You may need to specify which ingress controller to use when defining your ingress, if you haven't annotated an ingress as the default class
- The ingress controller to use is configured via an Ingress Class

    ```
### Working with Ingresses
- Get an ingress `kubectl get ing`
- Get an ingress class `kubectl get ingressclass`
    - Installed ingresses will be likely placed in an ingress namespace
- Sample ingress YAML:
    ```yaml
    apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
    kind: Ingress
    metadata:
    name: ckad
    spec:
    ingressClassName: <class name> # Specify which type of ingress to use
    rules:
    - host: <Host> # Some domain name if required, for host based routing
        http:
        paths:
        - pathType: Prefix
            path: "/path" # Include multiple paths for path baed routing
            backend:
            service:
                name: <Service> # Backend service name to send traffic to
                port: 
                number: <Port> # Service port
    ```
